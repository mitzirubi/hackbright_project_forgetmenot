# #Forgetmenot

Forgetmenot gives foodies the ability to keep track of the likes they want to remember, using the images geotag location. The app features the users favorited photos, places visited and a map view.  Users can keep track of the number of locations they have visited, write notes on their experience or keep track of their friends recommendations. The app shows users the place name, liked image, address, and has a geolocation feature that will show the user if any liked image locations are near them. Once the user decides on one of those food locations, they can click on the address found in the modal window, and be redirect to google maps for directions. Users can enjoy checking places of their list and adding more liked images later!
