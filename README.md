## <a name="run"></a>How to locally run Forgetmenot

* Set up and activate a python virtualenv, and install all dependencies:
    * `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * `source secrest.sh`
* Create the tables in your database:
    * `python -i model.py`
    * While in interactive mode, create tables: `db.create_all()`
* Next, seed your data (you must have an Instagram API key(remember to source your secrets!) before running your seed file. In this seed file you will make a request to both Instagram and google maps. Which will request the user liked images, and commit them to your database(WIP: OAuth):
   * `python seed.py`
* Start up the flask server:
    * `python server.py`

* Go to localhost:5000 to see the web app
